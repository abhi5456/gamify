# gamify

At it's core Gamify is very simple. It is a Unity extension that allows developers to make their games educational in an easy and unobstrusive way.

The extension pops up whenever the player engages in turn based combat. The pop-up asks them a question with terms sourced from Quizlet. 
If the player gets the question correctly, they gain an in game bonus - perhaps an increased chance at a critical hit, or bonus damage against a difficult boss character.

The developer worries about none of the educational aspects. 
They simply drag the prefab into the game, and add a line of code where they believe it would be appropriate for the pop-up to be created.

The player enjoys the freedom to play any game with this easy to add plugin installed by the developer, which widens their choices for agamified educational experience.

The player is also to study any public Quizlet set they wish to, whether that be about Spanish or Biology.

In this way, our product allows players to study what they wish, while they play what they wish.
